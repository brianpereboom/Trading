# Trading Utils
  ### This project uses the TD Ameritrade API and web scraping.
  ### The JSON files contain necessary URLs for scrape.py. Note: I do not condone using this code for illegal web scraping.
  ### No installation required. Include any necessary files from this repository in a trading script.
  ### api.py implements a delay. The TD Ameritrade API limits the frequency of requests, so decreasing the delay time may cause crashing.
